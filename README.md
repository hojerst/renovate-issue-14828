# Demo repo for renovatebot/renovate#14828

see https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/issues/14828

The necessary global config for a self-hosted setup to reproduce can be found in `runner-config/config.json`

Note: it works completely fine, when this `extends` block is used inside an actual repository.
